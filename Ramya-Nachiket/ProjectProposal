Project Motivation and Objective(s)

The data generation is increasing at an exponential rate. This has led to an increase in usage of distributed storage systems as data can’t be stored on the single node.
In this project we are planning to build a small distributed machine learning system and implement a few algorithms on it. We are trying to explore two broad approaches
in distributed machine learning systems namely data parallel and model parallel. The work we are planning to do would lead to exploration of the challenges faced when
running the machine learning algorithm in a distributed setting.

Task Assignments
1.Initially we are trying to set a basic distributed system with the Python Dask framework. The primitive and important step initially would be to set up the system with
worker nodes and master nodes and establish the connection between them.
2. We would also read papers on different algorithms that are to be run in a distributed setting. 

Deliverables and Timeline

25th October 2021 - Understanding basic concepts of distributed systems and reading the research work related to distributed machine learning algorithms.
5th November - Completion of the distribution system setup.
25th November - Implementation of the algorithms.
6th December - Testing and code refactoring.
12th December - Final presentation and report submission.
